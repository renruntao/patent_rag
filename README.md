# Patent Q&A Data Management System

A Flask-based web application for managing and generating patent-related Q&A data. This system helps users generate various types of questions based on existing patent Q&A pairs using different expert roles.

## Instantiated system demo

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/renruntao/patent_rag.git
cd patent_rag
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Configure your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
export OPENAI_API_BASE='your-api-base-url'
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage

1. **Upload Data**
   - Prepare your patent Q&A data in CSV format
   - Use the upload function to import your data
   - The system will automatically process and display the data

2. **Generate Questions**
   - Select an expert role from the dropdown menu
   - Set the number of questions to generate
   - Click the generate button next to any Q&A pair

3. **Search and Filter**
   - Use the search box to filter Q&A pairs
   - Results update in real-time
   - Highlights matching terms

4. **Export Data**
   - Select the questions you want to save
   - Click the export button to download as CSV

## API Integration

The system integrates with OpenAI's API for question generation. Each expert role has a specific system prompt that guides the AI in generating appropriate questions.

## Dataset Description

This project includes two simulated datasets:

1. **Patent Concept Search Queries Dataset** (`patent_concept_search_queries_train_dataset.jsonl`)
   - Simulates user queries about patent concepts
   - Contains positive and negative answer pairs
   - Used for training and evaluating system's concept understanding

2. **Patent Mistakes Search Queries Dataset** (`patent_mistakes_search_queries_train_dataset.jsonl`)
   - Simulates common errors and spelling variations in patent queries
   - Contains correct answers and related error examples
   - Used for improving system's error tolerance and query correction

These datasets are generated by large language models and are used for:
- System functionality testing
- Model training and fine-tuning
- User behavior simulation and analysis
- System performance evaluation
